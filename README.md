## About

A discord dictionary bot that gives the part of speech, definition, examples, origin, phonetics, synonyms and antonyms. This bot can take multiple inputs and gives the output for all the words after the command in a single message. A flask server is created to upload the discord bot on Repl.it and an uptime bot is used to ping the server every 5 minutes to ensure that the server does'nt go to sleep and the discord bot can be used anytime. The bot also checks if the message is more than 2000 (discord text limit) and splits the message and sends it accordingly.
